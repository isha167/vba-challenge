## VBA-Challenge
<H4> <u> Analyse the stockprices of 3 years using VBA
  
  <H6> A VBA challenge that was given as an assignment for my Data Bootcamp. In this project I was supposed to anaylse the stockprices in Excel workbook and produce the following results using VBA that runs simulataneously on all the worksheets 
    
   
  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red
  
    *There was a harder part of the challenge that required to produce the following results as well*
  * Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume"
  
    My code is comibnation of both the part I edited the same code to include both the solutions

   **Techonologies Used**
      
    
    For this I used VBA in Excel and I used VS to edit the code. For cross checking I used Excel 
     formulas to chcek my code on a sample data before I run it on all worksheets
